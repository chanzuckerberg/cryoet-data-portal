# Release Notes

:::{czi-warning} Attention
The v3 Python API was deprecated on Wednesday, February 26, 2025. Please update your Python API client to continue accessing the `cryoet-data-portal` package.
:::

## v4.X Python API

2 classes (Frame and GainFile) were modified and 1 class (PerSectionParameter) was added to the API. The changes are detailed below:

### Frame Class Modifications

| Name             | Status  | Nullable | Data Type | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| accumulatedDose  | New     | False    | float     | Dose (in e⁻/Å²) that was applied to the region of interest before this frame stack was acquired |
| exposureDose     | New     | False    | float     | Dose (in e⁻/Å²) that was applied during acquisition of this frame stack                         |
| dose             | Remove  | True     | float     | This is removed in favour of adding fields with more standardized naming.                       |
| rawAngle         | Remove  | True     | float     | This is moved to the perSectionParameter.rawAngle                                               |
