1. ## Introduction

   The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ("CZI", "we," "us," or "our") and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging work together to provide the CryoET Data Portal, aimed at driving the development of automated annotations of cryo-ET datasets.

   The CZ Imaging Institute is part of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network ("CZB") and was founded in support of CZ Science’s mission to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. At the CZ Imaging Institute, researchers will collaboratively develop revolutionary new imaging hardware and software tools to build breakthrough multimodal biological imaging systems.

2. ## Acceptance of this Privacy Policy

   This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to [https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com) (the “Website”) and any other products and projects of CZI that state that this Privacy Policy applies to our collection of personal information (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to products, programs, or activities of CZI that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference or that expressly refer to a separate privacy policy.

   By accessing and using the Services, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, which may be updated and amended from time to time. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that CZI is the “controller” of personal information which is provided to, collected by, or processed in connection with the Services. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Services.

3. ## Information We Collect About You

   ### From You

   We collect certain information from you when you provide it to us directly. Specifically:

   **Data Submissions.** When you decide to submit a dataset to the Services, we collect personal identifiers, such as your name and email address, as well as the fact that you consented to our data submission policy.

   **User Support.** If you email any @chanzuckerberg.com email address with a request or comment, you may provide us with personal identifiers such as your name, email address, contact information, and/or a description of the issue so that we can respond to the request or comment.

   **Surveys and Feedback.** If you decide to respond to a survey or send us feedback, we may collect personal identifiers and information about your interests or preferences.

   ### From Your Browser or Device

   When you use online services, certain information routinely gets created and logged automatically; the same is true when you visit our Website or use our Services. When you access or use our Services, we collect:

   **Log data.** When you visit our Website (whether on your computer or on a mobile device), we gather certain internet or other electronic network activity information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes your IP addresses and your Internet Service Provider.

   **Device data.** In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using to access the Website; this includes the type of device, browser type, operating system, settings, and unique device identifiers.

   ### From Other Sources

   When an uploader submits data to the Services, we collect certain personal identifiers, such as your author name or ORCID iD, that may be associated with the dataset. We may also add publicly available datasets to the Services that could include personal identifiers about you.

   ### Sensitive Information

   We do not collect sensitive personal information about you, and thus we do not use or disclose your sensitive personal information.

4. ## Use of Your Personal Data

   CZI collects and uses your personal data for the following business purposes:

   - To provide and maintain the Services, such as making datasets available for researchers and providing tools to analyze that data.
   - To analyze overall trends in Website traffic.
   - To provide you information and answer your questions.
   - To understand what you find valuable about the Services and how we can improve the Services.
   - To improve the Services by adding new functionality and features.
   - To create aggregated or de-identified information for statistical, analytical, and Service improvement purposes.
   - To secure the Services.

5. ## Retention and Deletion

   We will keep your information only for as long as we believe that we need it for the purpose we have collected it (as described above) or to meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements with you, or if applicable, fulfill your request to unsubscribe from further messages from us. When your information is no longer needed, we will destroy, de-identify, or aggregate it.

5. ## Disclosing Your Data

   We do not sell your data nor do we share your data for behavioral advertising purposes.

   Except in the instances listed below, we will not disclose your personal information to others unless you consent to it:

   - ### Service Providers and Vendors
     CZI works with vendors, service providers, and other partners that help us provide the Services. These services are, for example, sending emails, performing statistical analysis, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, survey providers, and security. In the course of providing these services, our service providers may have access to your personal information.

   - ### Affiliates and Partners
     We may share your information with our affiliates, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, LLC, and our collaboration partner, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network, and we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.

   - ### Legal and Safety Reasons
     We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (c) to protect or defend our rights or property or users of our Services or others; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation of the law.

   - ### Reorganization, Sale, or Merger
     If we can no longer keep operating the Services or believe that its purpose is better served by having another entity operating it, we may disclose your information in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of our organization or assets. We will always let you know prior to transferring the Services, and you will have the option to exercise your rights in Section 7 below.

7. ## Your Rights

   Applicable laws may provide you rights with request to your personal data, such as the right to: access and/or delete your data, object to our use of your data, not be discriminated against for exercising your rights, or revoke your consent to our use of your data. You can email us at privacy@chanzuckerberg.com to request to exercise your rights.

   If you would like an authorized agent to make a request for you, have that agent email us information sufficient for us to verify that the authorized agent is acting on your behalf.

   If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.

8. ## Data Transfer

   CZI is based in the United States. When you engage with our Services, you are sending personal information into the United States which may have different data protection rules than those of your country. We process data both inside and outside of the United States. For those located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), if we transfer your personal data outside of the EU or UK to a place that does not have a similar degree of protection for personal data (as described under GDPR), we will use other measures to protect your data such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).


9. ## Legal Basis for Processing Your Data

   We will collect, use and disclose your personal information only where we have a legal right to do so. Under GDPR, we may process your personal information under the following legal bases:

   - With your consent (where we request it), such as when you decide to voluntarily participate in a survey for feedback or agree to submit data to the Services.
   - For the performance of your contract with us and the provision of our Services to you.
   - Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
   - Our legitimate interests. For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how many visitors are coming to our Website so we can better understand the impact of our Services.

   Where we rely on consent, you have the right to revoke your consent and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object by emailing us at privacy@chanzuckerberg.com.

10. ## Children's Privacy

    The Services are not designed or intended for children under 16 and we do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of users under 16 years of age.
