1. ## Introduction

   The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ("CZI", "we," "us," or "our") and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging work together to provide the CryoET Data Portal, aimed at driving the development of automated annotations of cryo-ET datasets.

   The CZ Imaging Institute is part of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network ("CZB") and was founded in support of CZ Science’s mission to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. At the CZ Imaging Institute, researchers will collaboratively develop revolutionary new imaging hardware and software tools to build breakthrough multimodal biological imaging systems.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to products, programs, or activities of CZI that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference or that expressly refer to a separate privacy policy.

   By accessing and using the Services, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, which may be updated and amended from time to time. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that CZI is the “controller” of personal information which is provided to, collected by, or processed in connection with the Services. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Services.

3. ## Information We Collect About You

   ### From You

   We collect certain information from you when you provide it to us directly. Specifically:

   **Data Submissions.** When you decide to submit a dataset to the Services, we collect personal identifiers, such as your name and email address, as well as the fact that you consented to our data submission policy.

   **User Support.** If you email any @chanzuckerberg.com email address with a request or comment, you may provide us with personal identifiers such as your name, email address, contact information, and/or a description of the issue so that we can respond to the request or comment.

   **Surveys and Feedback.** If you decide to respond to a survey or send us feedback, we may collect personal identifiers and information about your interests or preferences.

   When an uploader submits data to the Services, we collect certain personal identifiers, such as your author name or ORCID iD, that may be associated with the dataset.

   ### Sensitive Information

   We do not collect sensitive personal information about you, and thus we do not use or disclose your sensitive personal information.

   - To secure the Services.

5. ## Retention and Deletion

   We will keep your information only for as long as we believe that we need it for the purpose we have collected it (as described above) or to meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements with you, or if applicable, fulfill your request to unsubscribe from further messages from us. When your information is no longer needed, we will destroy, de-identify, or aggregate it.

5. ## Disclosing Your Data

   We will not sell your data nor will we share your data for behavioral advertising purposes.

   Except in the instances listed below, we will not disclose your personal information to others unless you consent to it:

   - ### Service Providers and Vendors
     CZI works with vendors, service providers, and other partners that help us provide the Services. These services are, for example, sending emails, performing statistical analysis, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, survey providers, and security. In the course of providing these services, our service providers may have access to your personal information.

   - ### Affiliates and Partners
     We may share your information with our affiliates, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, LLC, and our collaboration partner, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network, and we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.

   - ### Reorganization, Sale, or Merger
     If we can no longer keep operating the Services or believe that its purpose is better served by having another entity operating it, we will transfer the Services and all data existing therein so that you can continue to be served. We will always let you know before this happens, and you will have the option to exercise your rights in Section 7 below.
