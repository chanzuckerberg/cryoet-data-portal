  Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Policy
</PageTitle>

<Body>
We respect the intellectual property rights of others. We require that content posted on the services does not violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, including copyright and trademark.

- If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated because of content you find on the services, you can request deletion of your intellectual property rights by following the process described below.
- If you have posted content to the services and someone claims that they own that intellectual property, you will be notified under the process described below.

## **Copyright**

Copyright is a legal right that seeks to protect original works of authorship (e.g., books, music, film, art, etc.). Generally, copyright protects original expression such as words or images. It does not protect facts and ideas, although it may protect the original words or images used to describe an idea. Copyright also doesn’t protect things like names, titles and slogans; however, another legal right called a trademark might protect those.

For more information on copyright law, you can visit the website of the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/) or the [World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)](http://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html). We can’t provide you with legal advice. Accordingly, please consult with an attorney if you have questions about intellectual property rights.

1. **Notification of Infringement**

Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (“CZI”) will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”). In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by us to be “repeat infringers.” If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content hosted on our website or the services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our designated copyright agent (“Designated Agent”) with the following information in writing (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these requirements and your compliance therewith):

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that website.
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please note that under the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.**

You may submit your notification of alleged copyright infringement by sending it to our “Designated Agent” by mail or e-mail as set forth below. A “Designated Agent” is an individual who has agreed to receive copyright infringement takedown requests for an online service under the DMCA.

Please note that we will send a copy of such notices (which will include the personal information you supply in your notice) to the individual who uploaded the allegedly infringing content.

2. **Counter-Notification**

If you elect to send us a counter-notice, after having been notified of a copyright claim submitted to us in accordance with Section 1 above, to be effective it must be a written communication that includes the following (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(g)(3) to confirm these requirements):

1. A physical or electronic signature of the user whose content was removed as a result of the copyright claim.
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
4. The user’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the user’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that the user will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 1 above or an agent of such person.

**Please note that under the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.**

We only accept counter-notices that meet the requirements set forth above and are received from the email address associated with the account on the services you used to upload the content within seven (7) business days of our forwarding you the DMCA notice. You may submit your counter-notification by sending it to our Designated Agent by mail or e-mail as set forth below.

3. **Designated Agent**

Our Designated Agent to receive notifications and counter-notifications of claimed infringement can be reached as follows:

```
Attention: Designated Agent
