/**
 * Returns props related to loading state.
 *
 * The `isLoading` prop is useful for
 * when a component needs to know about the immediate loading state.
 *
 * The `isLoadingDebounced` state is good for when a component needs to know
 * about the loading state after a short delay. For example, it is preferred to
 * use the debounced loading state for UI skeleton loaders because it prevents
 * the UI from quickly flashing the loading state when navigation to another
 * page is fast. This is especially noticeable when navigating to a cached route.
