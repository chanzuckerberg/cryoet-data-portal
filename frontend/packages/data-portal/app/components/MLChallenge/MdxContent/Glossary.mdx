## Glossary of Terms

#### 80S ribosome

- Ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate the genetic information from the intermediary mRNA templates into proteins. The 80S ribosome is specifically the eukaryotic ribosome, and it is abundant in cell lysate since translation of mRNA is a constant activity within the cell.

#### Apo-ferritin

- A 24-subunit globular protein in all cells and tissues. It binds and transports iron in all cells and tissues. Apoferritin refers to the iron-free form of the protein.

#### Annotating

- The process of identifying proteins or membranes of interest in noisy 3D tomograms.
- See also labeling and picking.

#### Beta-amylase

- An enzyme found primarily in plants and microbes that cleaves two bound glucose molecules (maltose) from the reducing end of a polysaccharide chain.

#### Beta-galactosidase

- A hydrolase enzyme also called lactase, active in almost every typical cell as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of larger sugars into smaller ones.

#### Cell lysate

- Fluid containing the contents of cells that have been lysed open by enzymatic, osmotic or mechanical disruption of the plasma membrane.

#### CryoET

- An imaging technique that enables 3D visualization of the cell at sub-nanometer resolution but, unlike other high-resolution imaging techniques, the cryogenic (frozen) condition preserves cellular architecture so this detailed view includes protein structures in their natural biological context.

#### CryoET Data Portal

- An open platform specifically designed to facilitate algorithm development, including by researchers outside the cryoET field. It expands on the data archiving and sharing efforts made by the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)35, and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank36, by providing a large collection of curated and standardized datasets and annotations under public domain (Creative Commons 0\) license, as well as a growing set of open source tools geared towards machine learning development and cryoET visualization.

#### Labeling

- The process of identifying proteins, membranes, reconstruction artifacts, contamination, or other non-cellular features of interest in noisy 3D tomograms.
- See also picking and annotating.

#### Particle

- Any molecule of interest within a 3D tomogram.

#### Phantom dataset

- A nomenclature used in the biomedical research community to denote objects used as stand-ins for tissues to ensure that systems and methods for imaging are operating correctly.

#### Picking

- The process of identifying proteins of interest in noisy 3D tomograms.
- See also annotating and labeling.

#### Thyroglobulin

- A protein produced by both normal and cancerous thyroid cells.

#### Tomogram

- Three-dimensional tomograms can be generated from hundreds of images of a thin slice through a cell, taken while tilting the specimen in multiple directions. A given tomogram is typically only about 200 nanometers thick—approximately five hundred times thinner than a sheet of paper—yet packed with information about the structures of the cellular machinery driving health and disease.

#### Virus-like Particles or VLPs

- Molecules that resemble viruses but are not infectious because they do not contain viral genetic material.
