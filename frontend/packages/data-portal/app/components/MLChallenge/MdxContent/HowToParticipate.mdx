### Rules

A truncated list of the rules is below ([see here for the full list of rules](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/czii-cryo-et-object-identification/rules)):

- **One account per participant:** You cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.
- **No private sharing outside teams:** Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's okay to share code if it's made available to all participants on the forums.
- **Team Limits:** The maximum team size is 5\.
- **Winner license type:** Open source. Specific licensing is [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
- Competition is open to residents of the United States and worldwide except where excluded by [Kaggle's terms](https://www.kaggle.com/terms) or the [competition eligibility rule](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/czii-cryo-et-object-identification/rules#7.-eligibility).

### Challenge Resources

To reduce the onboarding time for competitors, an extensive set of example notebooks is being provided. These include the following models:

- [3D U-Net](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html#unet)
- [DeepFindET](https://github.com/copick/DeepFindET)
- [TomoTwin](https://tomotwin-cryoet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

These notebooks also leverage the [copick library](https://copick.github.io/copick/) for handling cryoET datasets, for which we provide [PyTorch](https://github.com/copick/copick-torch) Datasets and [utility functions](https://github.com/copick/copick-utils) to simplify the creation of data loaders, metadata tracking, and model performance analysis.

These example notebooks can be found in the [Github Repository \- CZII ML Challenge Notebooks.](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks)

In addition, the [CryoET Data Portal](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/) provides multiple annotated datasets of protein complexes _in situ_ which can be used to tune machine learning algorithms to the crowded nature of _in situ_ samples.
