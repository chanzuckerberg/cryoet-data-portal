### Challenge Resources

To reduce the onboarding time for competitors, an extensive set of example notebooks was provided. These notebooks include the following models:

- [3D U-Net](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html#unet)
- [DeepFindET](https://github.com/copick/DeepFindET)
- [TomoTwin](https://tomotwin-cryoet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

These notebooks also leverage the [copick library](https://copick.github.io/copick/) for handling cryoET datasets, for which we provided [PyTorch](https://github.com/copick/copick-torch) Datasets and [utility functions](https://github.com/copick/copick-utils) to simplify the creation of data loaders, metadata tracking, and model performance analysis.

These example notebooks can be found in the [Github Repository \- CZII ML Challenge Notebooks.](https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/2024_czii_mlchallenge_notebooks)

In addition, the [CryoET Data Portal](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/) provides multiple annotated datasets of protein complexes _in situ_ which can be used to tune machine learning algorithms to the crowded nature of _in situ_ samples.
