              Currently, annotating tomograms from cryo-electron tomography
              (cryoET) experiments is a tedious, time-consuming, and often
              manual process. Our goal is to accelerate this process by
              catalyzing the development of sophisticated machine-learning
              methods for automatic annotation, helping researchers find
              scientific insights faster.

              The portal provides biologists and developers open access to
              high-quality, standardized, annotated data they can readily use to
              retrain or develop new annotation models and algorithms.
              Currently, the portal contains 13,861 tomograms from 53 datasets
              contributed by the groups of Julia Mahamid, JÃ¼rgen Plitzko, David
              Agard, John Briggs, Abhay Kotecha, Ben Engel, Danielle Grotjhan,
              and Grant Jensen.
            </p>
            <p>
              All tomograms include rich standardized metadata such as data tree
              structure and naming conventions. Most groups have already
              provided annotations for their data, and there is a structure to
              add new annotations to existing tomograms.

              We are actively growing the number of annotated datasets on the
              portal and encourage researchers to share their data. We are

              Ultimately, our vision is to contribute to developing a large,
              open-access database of annotated and validated 3D structural
              information for cells that researchers can use to gain new
              insights into cellular and structural biology.
