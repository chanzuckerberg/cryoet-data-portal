# CryoET Data Portal Documentation

The documentation website is currently hosted on https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cryoet-data-portal/.

The documentation site is rebuilt each time a tag is created on the repo, which happens on release. This will include the Sphinx website (for the Python API)

A full rebuild can also be triggered manually as the workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`. This should be done if a bug in the documentation is found and a release is not necessary.
