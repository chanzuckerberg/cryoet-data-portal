# CryoET Data Portal | Documentation

The [Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging (CZ Imaging Institute)](https://www.czimaginginstitute.org/) has made a beta release of the [CryoET Data Portal](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com) providing queryable and organized data from CryoET experiments. Each of the over 15,000 tomograms on the Portal have at least one structure annotated.

This site provides additional documentation for using our [Python API](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cryoet-data-portal/python-api.html) to query and download data and for navigating the [CryoET Data Portal](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com) and its visualization tools. We hope this site will assist segmentation algorithm developers to produce annotations for diverse macromolecules in the tomograms that may be used for high-resolution subtomogram averaging.

We welcome feedback from the community on the data structure, design and functionality.
- Share first impressions, or sign up for invites to future feedback activities in [this short form](https://airtable.com/apppmytRJXoXYTO9w/shrjmV9knAC7E7VVM?prefill_Event=P1BannerF&hide_Event=true).
- Submit bugs for the CryoET Data Portal via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cryoet-data-portal/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug.md&title=).
- Start a [Github discussion](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cryoet-data-portal/discussions/new/choose) with questions or to request new features.

## Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket Info

The CryoET Data Portal S3 bucket supports public access. The bucket URL is:

```
s3://cryoet-data-portal-public
```

To list the bucket contents with the S3 CLI without credentials, please use the following:

```
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://cryoet-data-portal-public
```

## CryoET Workflow Overview

![CZII Graphic Github](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cryoet-data-portal/assets/100323416/dc425098-d949-479f-b2f2-325f1c944784)

Electron Tomography workflow and the data we provide.

**A.** Sample is rotated to different tilt angles and electrons pass through to produce projection images of the 3D volume

**B.** We provide raw movie frames collected by a direct detector and may also provide these stacked into a tilt series of images

**C.** A 3D tomographic reconstructed volume is produced by back projecting projections which are first corrected in a variety of ways (motion correction, CTF estimation, etc.)

**D.** We provide the 3D volume together with any available point annotations or semantic segmentations of macromolecular complexes for each volume

## Citing the CryoET Data Portal

Data from the portal must acknowledge the data providers and the original publications. The following is provided as an example:

Some of the data used in this work was provided by the group(s) of Julia Mahamid (EMBL)/Jürgen Plitzko (MPI) [see [beta site](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com) for current details]. The work is described more fully in the publication:

| Provider | Julia Mahamid | Julia Mahamid | Jürgen Plitzko |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Dataset name | 10000 | 10001 | 10004 |
| Acknowledgement | [doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01746-2](http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01746-2) | [doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01746-2](http://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01746-2) | [doi:10.1101/2023.04.28.538734](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538734v1) |

:::{Note}
Segmentation experts and developers are also encouraged to get in touch with the data providers if they feel they have developed a useful tool that might help to process the entirety of the datasets (which are much larger than the subsets provided for the portal) more efficiently or effectively.
