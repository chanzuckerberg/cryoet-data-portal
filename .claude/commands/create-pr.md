# Create Pull Request Command

This command automates the creation of pull requests from existing commits. It should be used after running `/create-commits` to create logical commits.

## Command Usage

- `create-pr` - Basic usage with current branch (merges to main)
- `create-pr --draft` - Create PR in draft mode
- `create-pr --issue 123` - Link PR to issue #123
- `create-pr --base develop` - Create PR with custom base branch
- `create-pr --draft --issue 123` - Combine draft and issue flags
- `create-pr --base feature-abc --draft --issue 123` - Full example with all flags

### Flag Details

- `--base <branch-name>` - Specify the base branch to merge into (default: main)
  - Useful for creating PRs against feature branches or when working with dependent branches
  - Helps create cleaner diffs by avoiding commits from unrelated features
- `--draft` - Create PR in draft mode
- `--issue <number>` - Link PR to issue number

## Argument Parsing

```bash
# Parse command line arguments
DRAFT_FLAG=false
ISSUE_NUMBER=""
BASE_BRANCH="main"

# Parse arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --draft)
            DRAFT_FLAG=true
            shift
            ;;
        --issue)
            ISSUE_NUMBER="$2"
            shift 2
            ;;
        --issue=*)
            ISSUE_NUMBER="${1#*=}"
            shift
            ;;
        --base)
            BASE_BRANCH="$2"
            shift 2
            ;;
        --base=*)
            BASE_BRANCH="${1#*=}"
            shift
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Unknown argument: $1"
            shift
            ;;
    esac
done
```

## Prerequisites

This command expects that `/create-commits` has been run first to create logical commits. The workflow will:

1. Verify that the current branch has commits to push
2. Check if commits exist that haven't been pushed to remote
3. Proceed with PR creation if commits are available

## Workflow

### 1. Branch and Commit Validation

- Check current branch name using `git branch --show-current`
- Determine base branch (using parsed BASE_BRANCH variable, default: `main`)
- Validate base branch exists: `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/$BASE_BRANCH` or `git ls-remote --heads origin $BASE_BRANCH`
- Verify current branch is different from base branch ($BASE_BRANCH)
- Check for unpushed commits using `git log origin/<current-branch>..HEAD` or `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD`
- If no unpushed commits exist, inform user and exit

### 2. Branch Push and PR Creation

- Check if branch exists on remote: `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch-name>`
- If branch doesn't exist on remote OR has unpushed commits, push: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Analyze existing commit messages to determine primary scope and generate PR title
- Create PR body with:
  - **Issue**: If ISSUE_NUMBER is provided, add "#$ISSUE_NUMBER" at the very top on its own line
  - **Summary**: Brief overview of changes made (derived from commit messages)
  - **Changes**: Bullet list of major modifications (from commit history)
  - **Testing**: Instructions for testing the changes

#### PR Title Generation:

- Analyze commit messages from `git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline`
- Extract primary scope from most recent or most significant commit
- Use format: `<primary-scope>: <concise-description>`
- Example: `feat: add dataset metadata display functionality`

#### PR Body Format:

When ISSUE_NUMBER is provided, the PR body should start with the issue reference on its own line:
```
#1806

## Summary
Brief overview of changes...

## Changes
- List of modifications...

## Testing
- Testing instructions...
```

When no issue number is provided, start directly with the Summary section.

#### PR Creation Command:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<scope>: <title>" \
  --body "<generated-body>" \
  $(if $DRAFT_FLAG; then echo "--draft"; fi) \
  --head <branch-name> \
  --base $BASE_BRANCH
```

Where the base branch is determined by the parsed BASE_BRANCH variable (default: `main`)

## Error Handling

### No Commits to Push:

- If current branch has no unpushed commits, inform user to run `/create-commits` first
- Exit gracefully with instructions

### Git Conflicts:

- If branch is behind base branch, suggest rebasing first: `git rebase origin/$BASE_BRANCH`
- If conflicts exist, pause and request manual resolution

### Base Branch Validation:

- If specified base branch doesn't exist locally or remotely, list available branches and exit
- If current branch is the same as base branch, inform user they need to create commits on a feature branch first
- If base branch is not accessible, suggest fetching: `git fetch origin $BASE_BRANCH`

### Push Failures:

- If push fails due to authentication issues, provide GitHub CLI setup instructions
- If push is rejected due to branch protection rules, inform user and suggest draft PR creation

## Success Confirmation

After successful PR creation:

1. Display PR URL
2. Show commit summary with messages (from git log)
3. Confirm if created as draft (if DRAFT_FLAG is true)
4. Show linked issue number (if ISSUE_NUMBER is provided)
5. Display instructions for next steps (review process, testing, etc.)

## Advanced Features

### PR Body Generation:

- If issue number is provided, place it at the very top as "#ISSUE_NUMBER" on its own line
- Parse commit messages to extract meaningful summary
- Group related commits to describe feature scope
- Include testing instructions based on changed files:
  - **Frontend changes**: Include `cd frontend && pnpm test` and `cd frontend && pnpm e2e`
  - **Python client changes**: Include `cd client/python/cryoet_data_portal && make coverage`
  - **Documentation changes**: Include `cd docs && make html`
- Note: Do NOT use closing keywords like "Closes", "Fixes", or "Resolves" with issue references

### Base Branch Validation Requirements:

1. **Branch Existence Check**: Verify base branch exists using `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/$BASE_BRANCH` (local) or `git ls-remote --heads origin $BASE_BRANCH` (remote)
2. **Branch Accessibility**: Ensure base branch is up-to-date with remote: `git fetch origin $BASE_BRANCH`
3. **Self-Reference Prevention**: Prevent creating PR where current branch equals base branch
4. **Branch Relationship Validation**: Check if current branch has diverged from base branch using `git merge-base $BASE_BRANCH HEAD`

## Workflow Summary

1. **Validate Prerequisites**: Ensure commits exist and branch is ready for PR
2. **Push Branch**: Push to origin only if necessary (new branch or unpushed commits)
3. **Generate PR Content**: Create title and body from existing commit history
4. **Create PR**: Use GitHub CLI to create pull request with proper flags
5. **Confirm Success**: Display PR details and next steps
