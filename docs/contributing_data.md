# Contribute Data to the Portal

The CryoET Data Portal supports a rapidly growing cryoET data corpus because of generous contributions from researchers like you!

## Submission and Publication Process

1. Read our [data submission policy](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/data-submission-policy) (all data has a CC0 license) and [data schema](data-organization) to learn how data is shared and organized on the Portal.
2. Review the [metadata requirements](#metadata-requirements) to understand the requirements of data submission.
3. [Contact us](https://airtable.com/apppmytRJXoXYTO9w/shr5UxgeQcUTSGyiY?prefill_Event=Portal&hide_Event=true) and we'll reach out with next steps.

## Metadata Requirements

### Glossary

* **Deposition**: Depositions are collections of datasets, annotations, and/or (in the future) tomograms contributed by the same author(s). The website currently shows only depositions that include annotations
* **Dataset:** Datasets are contributed sets of files associated with imaging one sample type with the same experimental conditions
* **Run:** A tomography run is a collection of all data and annotations related to one physical location in a sample and is associated with a dataset that typically contains many other runs.
